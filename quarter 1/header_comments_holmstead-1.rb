# todo       Write a Ruby program which will prompt the user for 5 different items:
# todo    	Name
# todo    	Assignment
# todo	    Date
# todo    	Class Number
# todo    	Description


# todo 	    Store each of the above values into an appropriate variable name.


# todo     	Use these variables to print out a formatted Header Comment using the information from the user.
# todo      The header comment should look EXACTLY like the following, down to spacing, alignment, and number of #â€™s

# First I need to gather the information from the user then I will need to
# output that information in the correct form as shown on instructions.
# first area will be getting the Information (input)
# then I will have a code section for output

# input section of code
# for this area I need to make sure to collect all the pieces of data
